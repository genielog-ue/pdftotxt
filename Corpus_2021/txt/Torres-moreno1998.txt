This article presents a new incremental learning algorithm for classification tasks, called NetLines, which is well adapted for both binary
and real-valued input patterns. It generates small, compact feedforward
neural networks with one hidden layer of binary units and binary output
units. A convergence theorem ensures that solutions with a finite number of hidden units exist for both binary and real-valued input patterns.
An implementation for problems with more than two classes, valid
for any binary classifier, is proposed. The generalization error and
the size of the resulting networks are compared to the best published
results on well-known classification benchmarks. Early stopping is shown
to decrease overfitting, without improving the generalization performance.
