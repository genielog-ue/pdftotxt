Abstract : —In order to better adapt to society, an association
has developed a web chat application that allows anyone to
express and share their concerns and anguishes. Several thousand
anonymous conversations have been gathered and form a new
corpus of stories about human distress and social violence. We
present a method of corpus analysis combining unsupervised
learning and word embedding in order to bring out the themes
of this particular collection. We compare this approach with a
standard algorithm of the literature on a labeled corpus and
obtain very good results. An interpretation of the obtained
clusters collection confirms the interest of the method.
Keywords—word2vec, unsupervised learning, word embedding.
