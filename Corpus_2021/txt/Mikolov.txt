Abstract : 
We propose two novel model architectures for computing continuous vector representations of words from very large data sets. The quality of these representations
is measured in a word similarity task, and the results are compared to the previously best performing techniques based on different types of neural networks. We
observe large improvements in accuracy at much lower computational cost, i.e. it
takes less than a day to learn high quality word vectors from a
