Abstract

redundancy with previously read documents (history) has to be removed from the extract.
A natural way to go about update summarization
would be extracting temporal tags (dates, elapsed
times, temporal expressions...) (Mani and Wilson,
2000) or to automatically construct the timeline
from documents (Swan and Allan, 2000). These
temporal marks could be used to focus extracts on
the most recently written facts. However, most recently written facts are not necessarily new facts.
Machine Reading (MR) was used by (Hickl et
al., 2007) to construct knowledge representations
from clusters of documents. Sentences containing “new” information (i.e. that could not be inferred by any previously considered document)
are selected to generate summary. However, this
highly efficient approach (best system in DUC
2007 update) requires large linguistic resources.
(Witte et al., 2007) propose a rule-based system
based on fuzzy coreference cluster graphs. Again,
this approach requires to manually write the sentence ranking scheme. Several strategies remaining on post-processing redundancy removal techniques have been suggested. Extracts constructed
from history were used by (Boudin and TorresMoreno, 2007) to minimize history’s redundancy.
(Lin et al., 2007) have proposed a modified Maximal Marginal Relevance (MMR) (Carbonell and
